## Contribute to OpenTAP

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the OpenTAP project. Contributions include feature enhancement requests, issue reporting, bug fixes, etc. as well as plugins and other new code.

This guide contains details on how to contribute to OpenTAP in the simplest and most efficient way.

## Contributor License Agreement

OpenTAP requires contributors to sign a [Contributor License Agreement]( https://opentap.io/assets/OpenTAP-CLA-v2.pdf) (CLA).
The CLA can be executed either by an individual or a company. For companies, please include the company name and the name and signature of a legally authorized company representative.

Sign the CLA and forward it to [CLA@opentap.io](mailto:CLA@opentap.io) along with your GitHub username and your e-mail address.

> **Note:** Making minor fixes, such a correcting typos and editing non-critical information, can be accepted from anyone without a formal CLA in place. All other issues will require a CLA to be signed and submitted.  However, the rest of the process is the same.

## Contributing Code 

Once you have signed the CLA, project maintainers will review and accept pull requests containing fixes and enhancements to OpenTAP code and/or documentation.

In the issue tracker, the label `Accepting Merge Requests` indicates that OpenTAP project maintainers explicitly agree that the issue is valid and are looking for help creating a PR (Pull Request - other contributions are also welcome).

1. Identify an existing issue you want to work on, or submit a new one
2. Consult your peers in the community to seek consensus on the issue resolution. Having multiple sponsors for a change or enhancement makes it easier for the project maintainers to accept the contribution 
3. Assign the issue to yourself (or have a project member assign it to you)
4. Fork the repository
5. Develop and test (if code), then commit changes
6. Submit a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) back to [the root of the fork network](https://github.com/opentap/opentap)
